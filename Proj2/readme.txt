Project 2 Milestone\
\
Dataset: ALL dialogue of South Park\
\
I have completed the first visualization, which is a word cloud of the currently selected season.\
It\'92s pretty slow, so I plan to figure out how to improve this. It\'92s probably because of the sheer amount of text elements it creates, but I\'92m still working on it.\
\
I also plan to have a chronological representation of quantity of dialog/episode/season that will update based on the current selection.\
\
My last visualization will show shared words between seasons (one of those circle connection graphs)}
